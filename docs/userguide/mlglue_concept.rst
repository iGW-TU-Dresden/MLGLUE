The Concept of MLGLUE
=====================

In a nutshell, MLGLUE can be used to accelerate Bayesian inference of
(hydrological) model parameters.
In the following sections, general aspects about Bayesian inference as well
as the details about MLGLUE are explained. Plase also look at the original
publication about MLGLUE `here <https://doi.org/10.1029/2024WR037735>`_.
